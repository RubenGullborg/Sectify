          MIT License. Take it. Use it. Change it. The components are yours to
          do with as you please. Just keep the license text somewhere in your
          project, even if it's buried in a folder no one will ever open.

          What This Actually Means
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can use Sectify components for personal projects, commercial
          ventures, secret government operations or anything
          else your heart desires.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can modify them, improve them, or completely butcher them beyond
          recognition. It's your artistic journey, and we're just providing the
          canvas.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          The Fine Print (That's Actually Not Fine At All)
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Keep the license and copyright notice somewhere in your project. It
          doesn't need to be prominently displayed â€“ stuffed in a dusty corner
          of your codebase is fine.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We provide no warranties. If our components accidentally cause your application to only work on leap years during full
          moons, that's unfortunately on you. We tried our best, we promise.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why MIT?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We chose the MIT license because we genuinely want you to use our
          components without legal headaches. There are more restrictive
          licenses out there with more words and fewer permissions, but where's
          the fun in that?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Plus, the MIT license fits on a single screen without scrolling, which
          we consider a major feature of legal documentation in the age of tiktok attention spans.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Questions?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you have questions about the license that weren't answered by this
          unnecessarily verbose page, feel free to reach out. Our legal team
          (which consists of one developer who once watched an entire season of
          "Suits") will be happy to provide non-binding, possibly incorrect
          clarification.

        <div className="mt-12">
          <h3 className="text-sectifyLightPurple">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
          <p>
            Despite our casual tone, the MIT license is a real, legally binding
            license that gives you extensive rights to use our code. We've
            chosen it deliberately because we believe in open source and want to
            remove barriers to using and building upon our work. The only real
            requirement is keeping the license text, which acknowledges the
            original creators while protecting us from liability.
